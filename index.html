<p>Dear Randall Koutnik Seeking a Jr. Software Developer MVC, Java, SQL, Oracle for a fulltime employee position in Folsom, CA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an email title, you don't need to run it past the SEO guy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's fairly intimate already!  Will I get dinner out of this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please help pass along to colleagues or associates below position who are looking for new role. IF you are not available</p>
<p>Title : Jr. Software Developer</p>
<p>Location : Folsom CA</p>
<p>Salary – 70k</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't worry!  I'll spam my whole network with your terrible job just for you, so long as that dinner is good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mandatory Skills</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wasn't that a Weird Al album?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required to be US Citizen with the ability to obtain Federal DoD security clearance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like my days of rotating school desktops 180 degrees have come back to haunt me.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Formal computer science training and sound understanding and use of design patterns and theory, software engineering principles and structured development approach</li>
<li>Experience with multi-tier business application development</li>
<li>Demonstrated experience and proficiency with development of front end user interfaces, middle business application layers and back-end database design.</li>
<li>Experience in all phases of the software development life cycle</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>You do realize &quot;Experience&quot; means &quot;Not Junior&quot;, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Desired</p>
<ol>
<li>MVC, Java . SQL, Oracle</li>
<li>Professional coding in Java or .NET technologies</li>
<li>Professional experience with Oracle or SQL Server database design</li>
<li>Professional experience with mobile application development (Android or iOS)</li>
<li>Professional experience with Model-View-Controller (MVC) software frameworks</li>
<li>Professional experience with version control software, such as TFS</li>
<li>Professional UX design, User Experience and User Accessibility and testing experience</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Phew!  That's a lot for a junior to know.  I'm thinking 5 years of &quot;Professional experience&quot; might not be enough to qualify.  (Also, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/VcsSurvey.html">can we really call TFS &quot;Version control software&quot;</a>?)</p>
<p>I'd be impressed if an entire <em>team</em> had this skillset.  To throw it all in one &quot;Junior&quot; job is insulting.</p>

<p>Good thing you added that hashtag, otherwise I never would have figured out where you were located.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently we are looking for a Front End Developer and a Full Stack Developer to join our Rock Star team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only time you should use the phrase &quot;Rock Star team&quot; is if you actually <em>are</em> Rockstar games.  And you're not.</p>

<p>The AcmeWebWidgets team offers very competitive salaries</p>

<p>Introducing the Type A salary.  Never cooperate again!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>medical, dental and vision plans, matching 401K, unlimited paid time off, holiday time, and a relaxed worked environment, plus soft serve ice cream daily.</p>

<p>I think offering comprehensive insurance may be at odds with unlimited soft serve.</p>

<p>I wanted to reach out to you because I'm on the hunt for a Drupal Developer for a client in <strong>Atlanta</strong> which has proven to be pretty tough market so I'm pulling out all the stops to find the right candidate</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>All</em> of the stops?  Does this include dropping the spammy tactics and actually getting to know candidates?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The salary range for this position is $85,000 - $140,000</p>

<p>That's quite the range!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so if you know of ANYBODY who might be looking and is willing to work in <strong>Houston</strong> please send them my way and I would be more than happy to send you $1,000 if I can get them placed.</p>

<p>So all the stops means moving Atlanta halfway across the United States?  Man, you guys will do <em>anything</em> to get out of actually investigating us engineers.</p>
<p>(For bonus points, this was CC'd to about 40 others)</p>

<p>If my two years of experience qualifies me to be a &quot;Senior Software Engineer/Architect&quot; there, I'd hesitate to see what you offer someone who's actually <em>good</em>.  Double CTO perhaps?  I won't settle for anything less than Software Demigod.</p>

<p>My research put your background on my radar and it motivated to contact you, can I ask you to clear your thoughts for a moment?</p>
<p>I work for a unique firm that’s hired by some of the strongest VC’s, and private investors, that have launched some of the most successful startups in the bay to protect them from mediocre talent entering their startups. We build out their engineering teams. These startups we staff share a few common denominators, one they are run by management that refuses to hire anyone other than the top 15% and two these are leaders that have previously built teams considered to be role models in the bay by setting an incredibly high bar in the quality and pedigree of minds they hire.</p>
<p>My firm they use to do their “cherry picking”. Our sole focus is startup engineering, and I focus on Manager and Director level searches. Our typical placement has their heads down and are making important contributions with no interest in checking who’s smelled around their LI profile.</p>
<p>We are respected for our quiet trust in search and for the credibility we have in genuinely understanding the difference between SME’s and mediocre engineers. No “baiting” candidates with sales pitches. We listen then match. It’s been the primary reason, for our successes with Sequoia Capital’s portfolio.</p>
<p>If there’s a variance between where you’re today and ultimately where you see yourself ending up, let’s chat. Your call. I am not a chaser, if you know what I mean. Please take a comfortable exit if this is not the right time, but if you’d like to get to know one another, I am available, unrushed to chat.</p>
<p>I ask you respond to this so I know you have received it. Next step would be a call at your convenience.</p>
