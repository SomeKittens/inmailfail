<p>Closest thing I've got to &quot;rockstar experience&quot; is a solo for Jazz choir in 11th grade.  If you think <em>that's</em> impressive, you should see my kazoo skills.</p>

<p>A perfect match for completely different areas!</p>

<p>Thanks, I've been working on it lately.</p>

<p>Hello colleague ASAP!  It looks like we have many things to discuss.  Let's start with your bland recruiting emails.</p>

<p>Wasn't that a Weird Al album?</p>

<p>Required to be US Citizen with the ability to obtain Federal DoD security clearance</p>

<p>It looks like my days of rotating school desktops 180 degrees have come back to haunt me.</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Experience with multi-tier business application development</li>
<li>Demonstrated experience and proficiency with development of front end user interfaces, middle business application layers and back-end database design.</li>
<li>Experience in all phases of the software development life cycle</li>

<p>You do realize &quot;Experience&quot; means &quot;Not Junior&quot;, right?</p>

<p>Desired</p>

<li>Professional coding in Java or .NET technologies</li>
<li>Professional experience with Oracle or SQL Server database design</li>
<li>Professional experience with mobile application development (Android or iOS)</li>
<li>Professional experience with Model-View-Controller (MVC) software frameworks</li>
<li>Professional experience with version control software, such as TFS</li>
<li>Professional UX design, User Experience and User Accessibility and testing experience</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Phew!  That's a lot for a junior to know.  I'm thinking 5 years of &quot;Professional experience&quot; might not be enough to qualify.  (Also, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/VcsSurvey.html">can we really call TFS &quot;Version control software&quot;</a>?)</p>
<p>I'd be impressed if an entire <em>team</em> had this skillset.  To throw it all in one &quot;Junior&quot; job is insulting.</p>

<p><em>All</em> of the stops?  Does this include dropping the spammy tactics and actually getting to know candidates?</p>

<p>The salary range for this position is $85,000 - $140,000</p>

<p>That's quite the range!</p>

<p>My research put your background on my radar and it motivated to contact you, can I ask you to clear your thoughts for a moment?</p>
<p>I work for a unique firm that’s hired by some of the strongest VC’s, and private investors, that have launched some of the most successful startups in the bay to protect them from mediocre talent entering their startups. We build out their engineering teams. These startups we staff share a few common denominators, one they are run by management that refuses to hire anyone other than the top 15% and two these are leaders that have previously built teams considered to be role models in the bay by setting an incredibly high bar in the quality and pedigree of minds they hire.</p>
<p>My firm they use to do their “cherry picking”. Our sole focus is startup engineering, and I focus on Manager and Director level searches. Our typical placement has their heads down and are making important contributions with no interest in checking who’s smelled around their LI profile.</p>
<p>We are respected for our quiet trust in search and for the credibility we have in genuinely understanding the difference between SME’s and mediocre engineers. No “baiting” candidates with sales pitches. We listen then match. It’s been the primary reason, for our successes with Sequoia Capital’s portfolio.</p>
<p>If there’s a variance between where you’re today and ultimately where you see yourself ending up, let’s chat. Your call. I am not a chaser, if you know what I mean. Please take a comfortable exit if this is not the right time, but if you’d like to get to know one another, I am available, unrushed to chat.</p>
<p>I ask you respond to this so I know you have received it. Next step would be a call at your convenience.</p>
