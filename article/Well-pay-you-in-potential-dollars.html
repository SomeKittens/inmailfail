<p>Your technical skills and work experience may align to what we are in search of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only there were some way to confirm that online...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While you may be happy at $EMPLOYER, I would like to take a minute of your time to tell you about our new startup in Menlo Park called e-boz. e-boz is building a global trade platform with the potential to create an entirely new ecosystem for small and medium businesses worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My body has the <em>potential</em> to be converted into 4.8987976e+12 megajoules of energy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since our team is less than 10 people, you could be building and influencing the overall architecture from the ground up within this company!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I very well could!  I could not!  I could eat a doughnut tomorrow!  The possibilities are endless!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are proud of our modern technology environment, using current frameworks like MEAN stack for our Frontend and APIs (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.JS), Python + Flask for our backend services, and deploy to AWS using Ansible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, the ever-fluid BuzzStack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We put a lot of emphasis on agile development workflow and leverage all-cloud solutions to make our team as efficient as possible; our code is managed via GitHub, project tracking is done with JIRA Agile, and we use CircleCI for our Continuous Integration cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure why I'd need to know that you use CircleCI.  Good for you!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The founders are Bill Kerman and Peter Gibbons, who have already built five start-ups with successful exits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they're founding a sixth company, after five exits, I don't think you can keep calling them &quot;successful&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the company is still in stealth mode, it's hard to find info about it right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's another neat startup called &quot;Google&quot; that helped me out there.</p>
