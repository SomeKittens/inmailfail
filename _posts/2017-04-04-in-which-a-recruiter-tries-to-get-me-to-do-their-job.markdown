> I saw your profile and was hoping I could network with you a bit. I'm working with a HOT startup in San Francisco led by ex-googlers and leading venture capital, who are building a new platform that is going to be a real game changer in the Enterprise space worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Do you know of anyone I can share this with, who knows Javascript really well and can work with AngularJS Backbone.js or Node.js? $1000 referral bonus offered for anyone who accepts.
