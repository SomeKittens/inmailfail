> I wanted to reach out to you because I'm on the hunt for a Drupal Developer for a client in **Atlanta** which has proven to be pretty tough market so I'm pulling out all the stops to find the right candidate

*All* of the stops?  Does this include dropping the spammy tactics and actually getting to know candidates?

> The salary range for this position is $85,000 - $140,000

That's quite the range!

> so if you know of ANYBODY who might be looking and is willing to work in **Houston** please send them my way and I would be more than happy to send you $1,000 if I can get them placed.

So all the stops means moving Atlanta halfway across the United States?  Man, you guys will do *anything* to get out of actually investigating us engineers.

(For bonus points, this was CC'd to about 40 others)
