> Subject: Randall, the hiring Director of Eng at a successful

...and?  The suspense is killing me!

>I sent you this email not sure if you got it...

I did, though I'm not sure how I'd tell you otherwise.

>Are you still open to new opportunities? My associate Craig Aaron from BHO Tech forwarded your info.

Forwarded to whom?  What's this Craig doing with my info anyway?  Making a list?

>and the hiring Director of Eng at a successful,  company I'm currently working with, is interested in your technical background for a Senior position.

I'm response,  thanking.

>Typically they do a 30 minute phone interview.



>He is available next tomorrow Wednesday, Thursday at 1pm to 6pm.

Drat, I'm only free last yesterday.
