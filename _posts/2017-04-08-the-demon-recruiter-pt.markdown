> RE: Thanks for chatting! (ASAG)
 
...This is the first time I've heard from you.  Also, are you referring to the [Sumerian demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asag)?

>Oh, we haven’t spoken yet? Well if that’s the case, I must be psychic! 

Psychic demon recruiters.  This is my penance for starting InMail Fail, isn't it.

>Either way, kindly respond either way by "Accepting" or "Declining" my message so that I don't message you again wondering if you received it. 

This sounds ominously like foreshadowing.

>My client is revolutionizing how companies address customer feedback from social networks, leveraging big-data technologies to become the invisible fabric that enables enterprises to listen to and leverage the voice of their consumer-centric culture. 

THE DARK LORD DEMANDS BUZZWORDS.

>Why this is an AWESOME opportunity:
> Culture of growth – personal and professional 
> Competitive Salary + Equity + Health Benefits + 401k + Unlimited Vacation 

Sounds great!  I'll start tomorrow and be on vacation until 2020.

>Option to work remotely—when necessary

So that's what "vacation" means.

>I would welcome a conversation to discuss your experience and career objectives to see if this could be a match for you. 

Career objective: Maintain control of my own soul.
