RE: RE: RE: RE: Sorry not sorry.  Also, someone should tell ASAG the signature goes at the *end* of the message.

>I hope that I'm not coming across as too persistent,

The thought never crossed my mind.

>but per my previous correspondence, I would welcome the opportunity to have a conversation with you to discuss the below referenced opportunity.

I now have the opportunity to create the opportunity to discuss an opportunity.  We have to go deeper!

>Either way, kindly respond either way by "Accepting" or "Declining" my message so that I don't message you again wondering if you received it.

But who will provide InMail Fail fodder?

>If my timing is right, when would be a good time to schedule a call?

You're seventeen seconds too late, bub.

>My client is revolutionizing how companies address customer feedback from social networks, leveraging big-data technologies to become the invisible fabric that enables enterprises to listen to and leverage the voice of their consumer-centric culture.

"We look at mentions on Twitter and see if people are mad"

>They are conveniently located in San Francisco and have received $18M in funding, with only 47 employees.

A whopping $18MM?  What is this, amature hour?

>After checking-out your profile it looks like you have the ideal background for their Sr Software Engineer (Backend) need.

Their ideal backend engineer is a frontend engineer.  I like how you think.

>Culture of growth – personal and professional

Seriously though, what does this even mean?

>Competitive Salary + Equity + Health Benefits + 401k + Unlimited Vacation

So far you're just describing my current situation.

>$500 “fun budget” and Apple products

The air quotes around "fun budget" aren't helping your case

>Tons of snacks and endless flow of Nespresso!

Endless?!?  OH GOD THE CAFFEINE, SOMEONE, BUILD AN ARK!
