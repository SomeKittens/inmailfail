> RE: Checking back in! (ASAG)

You again.  Come to torment me a second time?

> I just wanted to make sure that you received my below email.

Signed, sealed, delivered, and ignored.

>If my timing is right, let's schedule a quick call so that I can share details about the position.

Unlike the details you've shared below?  WHAT ARE YOU HIDING FROM ME?

>Either way, kindly respond either way by "Accepting" or "Declining" my message so that I don't message you again wondering if you received it.

You're persistent, I'll give you that.

>Let me know.

Will publishing this on InMail Fail be enough of a message?

>My client is revolutionizing how companies address customer feedback from social networks, leveraging big-data technologies to become the invisible fabric that enables enterprises to listen to and leverage the voice of their consumer-centric culture.

So, customer support?

> They are conveniently located in San Francisco and have received $18M in funding, with only 47 employees.

So too late to get a decent slice of the equity pie, and too early to show any signs of real success.  Perfect!

>After checking-out your profile it looks like you have the ideal background for their Sr Software Engineer (Backend) need.

That's not how hyphens-work.

>Why this is an AWESOME opportunity: 

> • Culture of growth – personal and professional

Something tells me I don't want my job managing my personal growth.

>•$500 “fun budget” and Apple products

Even the budget is "fun sized"
