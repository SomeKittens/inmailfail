> I am a recruiter looking for a Senior Full-Stack or Back-End Software Engineer in the SF Bay Area for a rapidly growing and well-funded company.

I can only hope that said company puts in more effort to distinguish themselves from the competition.

> Great compensation!

Thanks, I've been working on it lately.

> You may have the experience my client needs.

>Please leave me your number or call my colleague ASAP to discuss.
